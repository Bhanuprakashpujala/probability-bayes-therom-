1. Define Experiment, Sample space, Outcome and Event.

2. What is probability and explain different types of probability?

3. In loan defaulters older people make up only 1.4%. Now the probability that someone defaults on a loan is 0.184, Find the probability of default on loan knowing that he is an old person. Older people make up only 0.8%

4. Define Bayes theorem and write the formulae.

5. Solve the below problem using Bayes theorem: 
Spam Assassin works by having users train the system. It looks for  patterns in the words in emails marked as spam by the user.
For example, it may have learned that the word “free” appears in 30%  of the mails marked as spam, i.e., P(Free | Spam) = 0.30. Assuming  1% of non-spam mail includes the word “free” and 50% of all mails  received by the user are spam, find the probability that a mail is  spam if the word “free” appears in it.
